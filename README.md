# MobKillTracker v3
(Yes, version 3 because I can't stand working with the old code)


## Improvements

All of these are unconfirmed but is thought to be done:
- Improved quality index
- More arranged and clean-ish code
- Less spaghetti and processing used
- Less laggy detections
- Now removes duplicated item on reloading
- Detects toss relatively properly now (with /mktd delay 0)

## Notice

This is still on WIP, changes may be made.

This is yet to be a complete project, hence do not use until an official release has been made!
